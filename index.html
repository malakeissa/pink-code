<p>I am currently learning to code with<a href=> Code First Girls</a>
  . Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...<p>
<ol>
<li>You can unerstand what is going on 'under the hood'</li>
<li>Not have to rely on someone else for quick prototyoe website</li>
<li> It's fun</li>
</ol>

<h1>What do you need to creat a website?</h1>

<p>Not much</p>
<ul>
<li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
<li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
<li> A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
<li> Some HTML,CSS and JS files
</ul>
